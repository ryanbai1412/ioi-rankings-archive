# IOI Rankings Archive

An archive of past IOI rankings, in the CMS format. You can visit the website [here](https://ioirankings.pages.dev).

The data obtained was scraped using [CMS Ranking Archiver](https://github.com/ioi/cms-ranking-archiver).
Please contact me (open a GitHub issue) if you have data for other years.

## Why?

Currently, the results of each IOI are stored at [stats.ioinformatics.org](https://stats.ioinformatics.org/).
While the website contains the scores of each competitor, compared to the CMS rankings it omits information such as submission logs and various graphs.
This data is rather valuable. For example, one can generate [contest footage](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/92192) using it.
In addition, analyzing the submission times of top competitors and seeing how they approach the contest and allocate their time can be educational to future contestants.
In any case, it is important that such data is preserved, for a more complete record of the past.

However, as CMS instances from old contests go down and are no longer accessible, some of this data is permanently lost.
This project aims to preserve as much of that data as possible, while also offering various quality of life improvements such as a more standardized format and links to the stats.ioinformatics.org pages for contestants.
